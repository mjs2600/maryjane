#Introduction

I am postdoctoral research associate specializing in physical chemistry at Oak Ridge National Lab where I use optical spectroscopy and microscopy for applications in basic energy science.
Mentored by [Warren S. Warren] (http://chem.duke.edu/labs/warren), who is the director of the [Center for Molecular and Biomolecular Imaging] (http://www.cmbi.duke.edu/) and is a member of the [Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics] (http://www.fitzpatrick.duke.edu/), I received my PhD in chemistry at Duke University where my research focused on using nonlinear optics to learn about biology and chemistry.
I also committed a significant amount of my effort at Duke to learning about college teaching and gaining experience as a teacher. I am interested in starting a career teaching chemistry at a teaching-focused university with an anticipated start date of August 2015.
