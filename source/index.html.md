#Introduction

In August 2016, I will begin as a new Associate in Science Instruction in the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/chem) at [Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu).

I just completed an appointment as a postdoctoral research associate specializing in physical chemistry in the [Chemical Sciences Division] (http://web.ornl.gov/sci/csd/) of [Oak Ridge National Lab] (https://www.ornl.gov/). With [Dr. Yingzhong Ma] (https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/yingzhong-ma), I used optical spectroscopy and microscopy for applications in [basic energy science] (http://science.energy.gov/bes/).

Mentored by [Warren S. Warren] (http://chem.duke.edu/labs/warren), who is the director of the [Center for Molecular and Biomolecular Imaging] (http://www.cmbi.duke.edu/) and is a member of the [Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics] (http://www.fitzpatrick.duke.edu/), I received my PhD in chemistry at Duke University in 2009 where my research focused on using nonlinear optics to learn about biology and chemistry. I also committed a significant amount of my effort at Duke to learning about college teaching and gaining experience as a teacher.
