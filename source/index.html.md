#Introduction

![Mary Jane Simpson](/images/mjheadshot.png)

I am a fifth year graduate student specializing in physical chemistry at [Duke University] (http://www.chem.duke.edu/).
Mentored by [Warren S. Warren] (http://www.chem.duke.edu/~wwarren/), who is the director of the [Center for Molecular and Biomolecular Imaging] (http://www.cmbi.duke.edu/) and is a member of the [Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics] (http://www.fitzpatrick.duke.edu/), my research focuses on using nonlinear optics to learn about biology and chemistry.
I have also committed a significant amount of my effort at Duke to learning about college teaching and gaining experience as a teacher.
I am interested in furthing my teaching and research experience as a post-doctoral associate or starting a career teaching chemistry at a teaching-focused university with an anticipated start date of August 2014.
