#Summary

I am a fifth year graduate student specializing in physical chemistry at Duke University.
Mentored by Warren S. Warren, my research focuses on using nonlinear optics to learn about biology and chemistry.
I have also committed a significant amount of my effort at Duke to learning about college teaching and gaining experience as a teacher.
I am interested in furthing my teaching and research experience as a post-doctoral associate or starting a career teaching chemistry at a teaching-focused university with an anticipated start date of August 2014.
