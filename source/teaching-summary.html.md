#Teaching

Higher education in the United States has reached a tipping point.
It has become ineffective and prohibitively expensive.
I am interested in modernizing the way college chemistry is taught by giving students a firm foothold on the basics of chemistry to minimize the need for repetition in advanced classes.

I am an effective teacher of chemistry because I have struggled with chemistry myself.
Having received a [certificate in college teaching] (http://gradschool.duke.edu/prof_dev/cct/index.php) from Duke University, I know modern pedagogical techniques.
I look forward to having undergraduates to mentor and a classroom of my own in order to refine my teaching abilities.
More than anything else, I want to teach students how to solve problems and think critically.
