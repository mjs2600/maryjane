I am an effective teacher of chemistry because I have struggled with chemistry myself and continually remind myself of that struggle by working with students who are experiencing chemistry for the first time.
I have received formal training through coursework and exercises to fulfill the requirements for the [certificate in college teaching] (http://gradschool.duke.edu/prof_dev/cct/index.php) at Duke University.
Less formally, I have observed great lecturers such as [Dr. James Bonk] (http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2001/04/25/bonk) and have attended workshops both at Duke and at [conferences] (http://www.frontiersinoptics.com/home/special-events/eday/).
Working with the [Duke Chemistry Outreach] (http://www.chem.duke.edu/outreach/lyle.php) team, I have learned how to explain difficult concepts to all ages.

I look forward to having undergraduates to mentor and a classroom of my own in order to refine my teaching abilities.
Dr. Bonk once said, "the best thing you can do to improve yourself as a teacher is throw your notes away at the end of the semester."
I will take every class I teach as an opportunity to update, revise, and reorganize the way I teach that class.
I am prepared to teach general chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and analytical chemistry, as well as specialty courses in the [Chemistry and Physics of Cooking] (http://people.duke.edu/~ms325/teaching-cooking-chemistry/) and [Biomedical Optical Imaging] (http://people.duke.edu/~ms325/teaching-biomedical-optical-imaging-syllabus/). 
More than anything else, I want to teach students how to solve problems and think critically.
