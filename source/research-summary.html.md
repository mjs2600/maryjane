##Visible Light Spectroscopic Chemical Imaging

Chemical imaging consists of forming an image where the contrast is based on a chemical’s identity. One way to identify a
chemical is to analyze the way that a chemical interacts with visible light, which is measured with visible light
spectroscopy. Color vision allows us to do visible light spectroscopy everyday. For example, we make assumptions about a
banana’s chemistry based on its color.

##How does visible light spectroscopy allow you to identify a chemical?

![Hydrogen spectrum](research/hydrogen_spectrum.png)
Photons, which make up light, are packets of energy. When an electron encounters a photon, it may absorb that energy, forming
a short-lived excited state. The exact energies that a ground-state electron can absorb are highly specific to individual
chemicals and depends on the nature of the orbital configurations. This picture shows the colors of the visible spectrum that
hydrogen is able to absorb. Astronomers can use this to help identify chemicals when looking at distant stars: whenever they
observe this signature, they know that hydrogen is present.

##Using the chemical signature to form a chemical image

![Pixelated bananas](research/pixelated_bananas.png)
One you know the way a chemical interacts with light, you can take measurements pixel-by-pixel to form an image with
microscale resolution. For example, since you know what chemicals the colors
correspond to when imaging bananas, you can map the chemicals that are present and form a "chemical image". This example may seem trivial because it can be easily done by eye, but chemicals which interact with light in similar ways are much harder to
discriminate. For example, if all of the chemicals that are present absorb exactly the same color(s) or have broad, poorly
defined absorptions, then they will prove challenging to differentiate.

##Making visible light spectroscopic chemical imaging more specific by measuring more parameters: transient absorption microscopy

![Three reds](research/three_reds.png)
Combining the ground state optical properties with additional parameters produces more specific chemical contrast that
allows discrimination of chemicals which have similar optical properties. For example, imagine you have three chemicals that
all appear red because their ground state electrons can absorb a blue photon. By incorporating additional information, you
can tell them apart. 

We require specialized equipment to make these measurements. Although excited state lifetimes are much to short to measure with a typical spectrometer, there are lasers that are fast enough to make measurements before the
chemical relaxes back down to the ground state. This type of measurement is called “transient absorption microscopy.” With
these lasers, you can probe the optical properties of the excited state and also measure the lifetime of the excited state.

##Applications of chemical imaging with transient absorption microscopy
