I received a B. S. in chemistry from Stetson University in 2009.
I received a Ph.D. in chemistry from Duke University in 2014.
In June 2016, I completed a postdoctoral research appointment in the Chemical Sciences Division at Oak Ridge National Lab.
Other than chemistry, I enjoy running, hiking, and dancing.
I currently live in Knoxville, TN with my husband, Michael, and toddler, Jack, but in August 2016, we will move to Middlebury, VT to start a new job as an Associate in Science Instruction at Middlebury College.
