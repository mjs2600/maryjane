I received a B. S. in chemistry from Stetson University in 2009.
I received a Ph.D. in chemistry from Duke University in 2014.
In June 2016, I completed a postdoctoral research appointment in the Chemical Sciences Division at Oak Ridge National Lab.
Other than chemistry, I enjoy running, hiking, and dancing.
I currently live in Knoxville, TN with my husband, Michael, and toddler, Jack. In August 2016, we will move to Middlebury, VT to start my new job as an Associate in Science Instruction at Middlebury College.
