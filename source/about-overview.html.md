I received a B. S. in chemistry from Stetson University in 2009.
I received a Ph.D. in chemistry from Duke University in 2014.
In August 2014, I began a postdoctoral research appointment at Oak Ridge National Lab.
Other than chemistry, I enjoy running, hiking, and dancing.
I currently live in Knoxville, TN with my husband, Michael, and toddler, Jack.
