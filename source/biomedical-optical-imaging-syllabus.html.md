#Biomedical Optical Imaging

##Summary:
Biomedical imaging serves a critical role in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease. 
Among the many imaging modalities, optical imaging is of particular importance for identifying specific biomarkers in native tissue. 
This course will first build a physical and chemical framework about biomedical optical imaging, which students will use to understand the techniques on the frontier of biomedical optical imaging research.

##Learning Objectives:

###After taking this class, students will be able to:
* Define a variety of biomedical optical imaging techniques and explain their limitations
* Diagram an optical set-up such as a laser or a microscope
* Apply principles of physical chemistry to write an optical imaging proposal
* Evaluate a recent scientific article about optical imaging

##Weekly topics:

###	Review of principles of relevant principles of physical chemistry

* Electronic and vibrational energy levels
* Excitation via heat and via photons
* Radiative and non-radiative relaxation
* Excited state lifetimes

###	Spectroscopy: linear optics

* Sources of light: blackbody radiation, atomic emission, LEDs
* Detecting light: photodiodes, PMTs
* Linear absorption spectroscopy experimentally
* Assignment: Given the spectrum of sunlight, calculate the temperature of the sun. What are some of the reasons why this number is incorrect?

###	Lasers

*	Stimulated emission
*	Coherence
*	Population inversion
*	Pulsed laser light
*	Assignment: Draw a model of a CW or pulsed laser that emits at a given frequency. Label all parts including the pump source and the gain medium.

###	Nonlinear optics

*	Index of refraction and kerr lensing
*	Pulse compression
*	Two-photon absorption and fluorescence
*	Assignment: Given a large objective with known GVD, calculate the appropriate distance between prisms in a dispersion compensating prism pair.

###	Microscopes

*	Review of ray optics
*	Resolution limit
*	Overview of several types of microscopes: bright-field, polarized light, confocal, fluorescence
*	Assignment 1: Label the image and focal planes on a given microscope.
*	Assignment 2: Calculate the x, y, and z resolution of a given microscope set-up.

###	Two-color nonlinear optics experiments

*	Producing two colors that are coherent: second harmonic generation, optical parametric oscillator
*	Cross-phase modulation, stimulated Raman, stimulated emission, ground state bleaching, excited state absorption
*	Detecting two-color interactions: AOMs, EOMs, chopping
*	Assignment: Given a measured pulse cross-correlation, calculate the approximate pulse-width.

###	Biomedical optical imaging with extrinsic contrast

*	Fluorescence quenching mechanisms
*	FRET
*	SERS
*	Upconversion dyes
*	Health concerns about dyes

###	Biomedical optical imaging with intrinsic contrast

*	Student presentations: applications from current literature of all kinds of optical imaging 
*	Short summary/clarification also given by instructor

##Final Project

Write a SURE grant proposal for an original research proposal based on biomedical imaging (may include modalities other than optical if desired).
