#Biomedical Optical Imaging

##Summary:
Biomedical imaging serves a critical role in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease. 
Among the many imaging modalities, optical imaging is of particular importance for identifying specific biomarkers in native tissue. 
This course will first build a physical and chemical framework about biomedical optical imaging, which students will use to understand the techniques on the frontier of biomedical optical imaging research.

##Learning Objectives:

###After taking this class, students will be able to:
* Define a variety of biomedical optical imaging techniques and explain their limitations
