# Teaching Philosophy

##Personal experience and formal training

I was first attracted to chemistry because it was the first class I found challenging. 
Having worked so much to master the field myself, I am now an effective teacher because I relate to students who are experiencing chemistry for the first time.
I have received formal college teaching training through coursework and exercises to fulfill the requirements for the
[certificate in college teaching](https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching)
at Duke University.

Less formally, I have observed great lecturers such as [Dr. James Bonk](http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2001/04/25/bonk) 
and have attended workshops both at Duke and at [conferences](http://www.frontiersinoptics.com/home/about-fio-ls/2013-recap/).
Working with the [Duke Chemistry Outreach team] (https://chem.duke.edu/outreach), 
I have learned how to explain scientific concepts to all ages.

##Committed to continuing education, reflection, and improvement

I look forward to having undergraduates to mentor and a classroom of my own in order to refine my teaching abilities.
Dr. Bonk once said, "the best thing you can do to improve yourself as a teacher is throw your notes away at the end of the semester."
I will take every class I teach as an opportunity to update, revise, and reorganize the way I teach that class.
At the completion of a course, I will judge my success as a teacher on how well students can implement concepts that we
covered and how much they have developed as thinkers.
This will help me to refine my approach to teaching and be more effective in the future.

##Diverse background makes me versatile

Although I am most interested in teaching chemistry to non-majors, 
I am prepared to teach general chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and analytical chemistry, 
and I would like to develop specialty courses in the [Chemistry and Physics of Cooking] (http://people.duke.edu/~ms325/teaching-cooking-chemistry/), [Biomedical Optical Imaging] (http://people.duke.edu/~ms325/teaching-biomedical-optical-imaging-syllabus/), and [Optical Spectroscopy in Environmental Science] (http://people.duke.edu/~ms325/teaching-environmental-photonics/).
More than anything else, I want to teach students how to solve problems and think critically.
