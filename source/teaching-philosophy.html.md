Chemistry class is about more than just the periodic table, stoichiometry, and gas laws: it is a critical component of a liberal arts education.

##Problem solving and critical thinking disguised as a chemistry class

Through chemistry, students can cultivate a variety of skills necessary to becoming a successful, independent adult.
I will empower students to think critically and creatively and to solve problems in the context of chemistry.
One of my goals as a chemistry professor is teaching students to analyze information critically.
For example, teaching students about significant figures shows students that all measurements are uncertain and that they should first consider the uncertainty of a measurement to understand its value.
Everyone needs a rudimentary understanding of uncertainty to participate in discussions across a range of important topics such as global warming, political polling, and forensic evidence.
I will incorporate critical thinking into my classes by having students analyze the assumptions and uncertainties associated with general formulas and other rules they are learning in class, as well as having discussions about current topics of interest.

##Theme-based labs keep chemistry class relevant to non-majors

Another one of my goals will be developing theme-based chemistry classes and/or labs, particularly for non-major students.
Rather than teaching a traditional non-majors general chemistry class that may not be particularly meaningful to my students,
I will pick content that is easily applied to topics that are interesting and relevant to my students because students learn best when they are interested in the material.
A few examples include: medical chemistry, cooking chemistry, color chemistry (eg. paint pigments, geology, etc.), lawn and home chemistry (eg. cleaning supplies, fertilizers, etc.), and chemistry in history (eg. the development of the atomic bomb).
