Can you see that invisible laser beam?

Researchers working with invisible lasers have reported perceiving invisible light as visible light. Normal human vision is sensitive to light between 400-800 nm, but according to the report in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences] (http://www.pnas.org/content/111/50/E5445), some humans can see light that is over 1000 nm, which is too low energy to activate the light-sensitive molecules in the eyes. This study explores the mechanism through a variety of means including *shooting lasers into the eyes of healthy volunteers*! The authors suggest that the light-sensitive molecules in eyes, which normally activate upon activation with 500 nm blue light, can instead absorb two photons of the 1000 nm invisble light. Although these results are quite plausible, the surprising part of this article is that noone got hurt, as absorbing two photons simultaneously requires a fairly powerful laser pulse.
