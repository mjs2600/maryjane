Wide-spread use of antibiotics in healthcare and in animal husbandry has become a major public health concern. Why?

Antibiotics build up in the environment, allowing bacteria to build up resistance to the latest and greatest of drugs. 
The [CDC reported] (http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/) that every year, at least 2 million people in the U.S. become infected with multi-drug resistant infections including pneumonia, gonorrhea, and infections of the bloodstream and urinary tract.

An article in [Nature Chemistry] (http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nchem.1750.html) last month demonstrated a possible solution to this problem: light activated antibiotics. 
Velema et al developed molecules that have no anti-microbial activity in the dark, but after undergoing a conformational change from exposure to light, they can kill bacteria. 
Once the light is turned off, the drug gradually switches back to the original, inactive form. 
With clever timing, a drug could be activated before giving it to a patient, making it an effective antibiotic while in the body, but any un-metabolized drug the patient excretes will deactivate rather than building up in the environment.
