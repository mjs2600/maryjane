To analyze the layers in a painting, art conservators normally must take a paint chip off a painting using a scalpel.
Then, they can look at the chip cross section under a microscope.
New laser technology out of Duke University allows conservators to take a virtual cross section,
allowing non-destructive analysis of paint layers.
Reported this week in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences] (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/01/16/1317230111), paints have a two-photon transient absorption signature that uniquely identifies them. Because two-photon laser microscopy can resolve signals from thin focal planes, conservators can image individual paint layers and potentially find hidden paintings.
