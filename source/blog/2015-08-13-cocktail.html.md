The cocktail party problem is a famous signal processing problem. 
During a cocktail party, there are many people speaking at once,
which makes it difficult to pick out individual voices from the crowd.

Although there are several signal processing algorithms that have been developed to solve this problem,
engineers at [Duke University](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~cummer/index.html) have created an acoustic metamaterial hardware solution.
Reported this week in the [Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/08/05/1502276112.full.pdf), the 3-D printed device is meant to mimic the human
ear. 
The circular device contains many openings for sound to come in, and each opening leads the acoustic waves down separate pathd,
and this process uniquely encodes each channel.
For demonstration, the team placed three independent speakers around the device and had each speaker emit a series of tones at various frequencies.
The device successfully reconstructed not only the contributions from each speaker but also the location of the speaker with respect to the device.
