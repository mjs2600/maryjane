Reported in [Nature News] (http://www.nature.com/news/widely-used-herbicide-linked-to-cancer-1.17181), the IARC has found that a popular weed-killer is a probably carcinogen, but how dangerous is this chemical?

Roundup is the tradename for glyphosate, which is an herbicide. It kills plants by interfereing with a plant's metabolism. It became extremely popular in the late 1990s because Monsanto, an agricultural company, developed plants that were immune to the effects of Roundup. This meant that farmers could treat their fields with Roundup to kill all plants except their crops. 

However, a chemical that is toxic to plants could be toxic to animals, too, so scientists have been studying Roundup to determine what effects it might have on humans. There are 3 main ways to make sure a chemical is safe: *in vitro* studies, *in vivo* studies, and human studies. *In vitro* studies, which are conducted on cells in a petri dish, show that Roundup is capable of damaging DNA, which suggests it could cause cancer in humans. *In vivo* studies on mice and rats suggest it can cause cancer in these animals. However, human studies have failed to show proof that it can cause cancer. Human studies are more complicated because it is unethical to purposely expose a human to a possible carcinogen, so these studies rely on studies on people who were exposed while doing their jobs. Some studies suggested that it may cause an increased incidence of cancer in people working with the chemical (such as farmers and chemical manufacturers), but other equally rigorous studies contradict those findings. Based on this evidence, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that Roundup is probably a carcinogen, placing it in category 2a. 

This made me curious about the carcinogens in the different categories. What else am I exposed to that may be causing cancer? The short answer: a lot of things. Check out a few that caught my eye.

Category 1 (definitely carcinogens): sunlight, ethanol (from fermented beverages such as beer or wine), air pollution, mineral oil, soot, salted fish

Category 2a (probably carcinogens): red meat, shift work (that interferes with the normal circadian clock), anabolic steroids, nitrates (as in cured meat), high temperature frying, wood-burning stoves

Category 2b (possibly carcinogens): coffee, baby powder, pickled vegetables, engine exhaust, TiO2-based sunblock, cell phones, birth control pills, mothballs

Category 3 (not enough evidence to decide if its a carcinogen or not): caffeine, cholesterol, electric fields, rust, fluorescent lighting, gastric acid, sand, tannins (from consumption of tea and/or red wine, or from exposure to tanned leather)
