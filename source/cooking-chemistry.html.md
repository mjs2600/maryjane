#Chemistry and Physics of Cooking 

##Introduction:

Gastronomy is growing in popularity and democratizing. 
This process has transformed its main artists into stars. 
But beyond their fame, what do Ferran Adrià, Heston Blumenthal, Joan Roca, and Hervé This have in common? 
They all question our culinary knowledge by creating gastronomic art using science. 
Traditional techniques used to be followed blindly; they are now deconstructed, explained, and revisited. 
It’s been an art, it is now also a science. 
Welcome to a science class where fun and play are in order!

##Goals:
* Demystify cooking by scientifically exploring its main techniques
* Discover the tools and technologies used by world-leading chefs for artistic creation
* Develop an interest in culinary creation
* Educate one’s sense of taste
* Value notions of sustainability

##Learning Objectives:
* Design a unique artistic food
* Demonstrate and explain state of the art cooking technology
* Predict the outcome of a food experiment
* Explain the chemical and physical reactions involved in transforming food 
* Discuss nutritional value and how it relates to cooking methods
