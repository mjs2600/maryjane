#Chemistry and Physics of Cooking 

##Introduction:

Gastronomy is growing in popularity and democratizing. 
This process has transformed its main artists into stars. 
But beyond their fame, what do Ferran Adrià, Heston Blumenthal, Joan Roca, and Hervé This have in common? 
They all question our culinary knowledge by creating gastronomic art using science. 
Traditional techniques used to be followed blindly; they are now deconstructed, explained, and revisited. 
It’s been an art, it is now also a science. 
Welcome to a science class where fun and play are in order!

##Goals:
* Demystify cooking by scientifically exploring its main techniques
* Discover the tools and technologies used by world-leading chefs for artistic creation
* Develop an interest in culinary creation
* Educate one’s sense of taste
* Value notions of sustainability

##Learning Objectives:
* Design a unique artistic food
* Demonstrate and explain state of the art cooking technology
* Predict the outcome of a food experiment
* Explain the chemical and physical reactions involved in transforming food 
* Discuss nutritional value and how it relates to cooking methods

##Weekly Topics:

###“Why do we eat?”	

* Energy, entropy, enthalpy
* Photosynthesis
* Fusion
* Solubility 	
* Assignment 1: Trace energy transfer reactions back to fusion in the sun
* Assignment 2: Estimate the number of calories contained in a gram of glucose based on the energy released from the oxidation of glucose.

###“What do we like to eat and why?”	

* Evolution of the human diet
* Digestion
* Senses of smell and taste
* Vitamins and minerals	
* Assignment 1: Map out destinations and roles of various nutrients in the human body	
* Assignment 2: Consider one of your favorite foods and explain, from a biological perspective, why you think you like it.

###“What role do bacteria and fungi play in food?”	

* Electrostatics
* Self-assembly
* Bacteria
* Fungi
* Food safety
* Preservatives
* Assignment 1: Discuss foods that one culture eats but others don’t and hypothesize about why that culture likes it	
* Assignment 2: Try a food that is new for you. Write a summary about what you did and didn’t like about it. Then, talk about the food to someone who does like it and ask them why.

###“What is food made of?”	Biochemical composition of food

* Fats
* Carbohydrates
* Proteins
* Assignment 1: Make a list of ways to identify chemical reactions. Consider whether or not a given case is a reaction.	
* Assignment 2: List five or more chemical reactions and changes in state that occur in the preparation of a favorite food.

###“Why do we cook our food?”	

* Molecular motion
* Temperature
* Energy absorption
* Oxidation
* Protein denaturation	
* Assignment 1: Debate the benefits and consequences of cooking and/or processing food. Decide if your example food should be cooked or eaten raw.	
* Assignment 2: Compare the nutritional content of your favorite vegetable raw and cooked two different ways. Read an abstract on PubMed about the nutritional differences between eating that food raw or cooked and prepare a short summary.

###“How can we cook our food?”	

* Molecular structure and phase behavior
* Phase diagrams
* Equilibrium
* Critical temperatures
* Microwaves
* Heat lamps	
* Assignment 1: For a given food, hypothesize and explain how it will react to being cooled, heated, or microwaved.

###“How does cooking food change it?”	

* Acids and bases
* pH
* Acid/base reactions

###“How can we manipulate texture?”	

* Intermolecular forces
* Viscosity and elasticity

###“How can we manipulate texture?”

* Physical process of gelation
* Chemical gels
* Physical gels
* Pectin
* Advanced gelation agents

###“What role do yeast play in food?” 	

* Yeast
* Fermentation
* Review of ideal gas law
* Stoichiometry	
* Assignment 1:	Map out how a wart becomes a beer. Include relevant chemical equations.	
* Assignment 2: Calculate the pressure and molarity of carbon dioxide in a bottle of champagne that has fermented until the yeast died.

###“What makes watery food thick?”	

* Emulsions
* Thickeners
* Starch
* Foams and stabilizers
	
###“How can we make sugar delicious and beautiful?”	

* Saturation
* Super-saturation
* Crystallization
* Caramelization
* Sugars	

##Midterm Paper

I would like each of you to contribute by suggesting a creative dish that we could make for the last day of class. 
In 2 pages (between 750-1000 words), explain your idea for a dish. 
Feel free to include figures, pictures, and diagrams if appropriate. 

You will be randomly assigned a dinner course.

1.	Bouchée
2.	Cold dish or soup
3.	Fish and/or seafood
4.	Vegetarian
5.	Meat
6.	Dessert

For the creative side, consider focusing on one or more of the following questions:
	
1. How could you make a food in a new way (such as a bread without a starch)?
2. How could you make a food that has new flavor, taste, and/or texture combinations (such as something fruit-flavored but not predominantly sweet-tasting)?
3. How could you prepare a food in a new way to emphasize a particular flavor or quality (such as making something fish-flavored that is shaped like a fish, but is not actually fish)?

A high scoring paper will be unique and creative and incorporate (three) 3 scientific arguments from the lectures and/or textbooks with appropriate references in JACS (Journal of the American Chemical Society) format where appropriate. 

*	For example, if you plan on extracting a flavor into a fat, explain why you chose a fat rather than alcohol or water; or if you chose an unusual flavor pairing, reference the reason you chose that flavor combination. 
*	Although the idea can be a unique spin on something you found in a book or the internet, this project is a creative project and should mostly be your own idea. Cite the source if you are adapting an idea that you found. 
*	A recipe is not expected, rather an idea that the chef could potentially turn into a recipe. 
*	As with any written document, it should be well-organized and grammatically correct.

##Final Project

I have chosen the best dishes from the midterms that we will taste on the last day of class. 
In groups of three, you will prepare a short presentation (with supporting audio-visual material) about the chemistry and physics involved in cooking, assembling or tasting your assigned dish. 
The presentation should last 10-15 minutes. 
Each group should present concepts from two to three different lectures at a similar level of complexity as in your written documents. 
Student grades will be based on the presentation as a whole and on the group self-evaluation.

A high scoring presentation will be:

*	Scientifically accurate
*	Inclusive of concepts from at least two lectures
*	Appropriately illustrated
*	Well-organized
*	Well-rehearsed and interesting 
*	Within the time limit.

You may reuse content from any of the lectures.
