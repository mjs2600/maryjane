#Teaching Experience

##Chemistry and Physics of Cooking Teaching Fellow

![Optics Outreach](chemistry-outreach.jpg)

I designed and taught a new freshman-level course as a team with an assistant professor, a chef, and another graduate student teaching fellow. Based on a course taught at Harvard, we reworked the syllabus, revised the labs, wrote new problem sets, class projects, and lectures. Whereas the Harvard class focused on the physics of cooking for a large group of students who had a background in science, our class focused on both the chemistry and physics of cooking for a small group of students (18 students) who had little background in science. The purpose of this class was to foster an interest in science through the cooking application. I taught four of the twelve, 75-minute lectures throughout the semester.

I would be interested in teaching this course, again, although I would need a chef partner and test kitchen in order to do the lab portion. However, I would make plenty of changes. It would be more discussion-based than lecture-based and would include not just physical and chemical principals but also biological. The revised syllabus is in the [sample syllabi] (http://people.duke.edu/~ms325/teaching-cooking-chemistry/) section of my portfolio. A short sample lecture is shown [here] (http://www.chem.duke.edu/~janet/chem89Preview.pdf).

##Mentoring Undergraduates in Research

I have mentored two undergraduate students in research, Marshall A. Phipps (Trinity '12) and Christopher P. Dall (Trinity '13).
Both of them coauthored [peer-reviewed articles] (http://people.duke.edu/~ms325/research-publications/) with me.
Marshall and Christopher are both currently working while applying to medical school.

##Chemistry Outreach Volunteer

I planned and performed demonstrations and activities to teach school-age children about optics. The topics included laser safety, collimated light, colors, manipulating light with lenses, mirrors and gratings, and coherence/interference.

With the chemistry outreach coordinator, Dr. Ken Lyle, I performed demonstrations and supervised activities that he designed to teach children about chemistry. I also helped perform demonstrations for a Coursera online introductory chemistry course (expected to debut Spring 2014).

##General Chemistry Recitation Head Teaching Assistant

I came up with discussion topics to help students review topics that they struggled with on exams and on homework sets. My recitation sections were groups of 8-10 students. I wrote challenge problems and presented them to help students prepare for exams. I met with students outside of class on an individual basis. I also graded and proctored their exams.

##Organic Chemistry Lab Teaching Assistant

I led a short pre-lab discussion, then guided students through organic chemistry labs. I also graded their lab reports and exams.

##General Chemistry Lab Teaching Assistant

I led a short pre-lab discussion, then guided students through general chemistry labs. I also graded their lab reports and exams.

##Private Chemistry Tutor

I have tutored a range of levels including high school general chemistry to second semester general chemistry, both as a community volunteer and for pay, since 2006.
