#Biomedical Optical Imaging

##Summary:
Tools based on optical spectroscopy are at the cutting edge of research in environmental science. 
This course will first build a physical and chemical framework about optical spectroscopy. 
Then, students will explore current applications, which include remote sensing of pollutants and monitoring climate change.

##Learning Objectives:

###After taking this class, students will be able to:
* Define a variety of optical imaging techniques and explain their limitations
* Explain an optical set-up such as a laser
* Evaluate a recent scientific article about optical spectroscopy applied to environmental science. Present the articles and evaluations in class
* Apply principles of physical chemistry to write an optical imaging proposal. Critique peer proposals
