Title: Need another excuse to satisfy your chocolate craving?
---

Reported in the [New England Journal of Medicine] (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMon1211064), scientists have found that increased chocolate consumption per capita is correlated with an increased number of Nobel prizes.
They noted that the minimally effective dose was about 2 kg of chocolate per year, but the data showed no apparent ceiling, even at the highest chocolate consumption (11 kg per year - more than an ounce a day!).
The authors attributed this trend to chocolate's ability to enhance cognitive function, but they added, "It remains to be determined whether the consumption of chocolate is the underlying mechanism for the observed association with improved cognitive function."

Here at Duke, I can only assume that my daily dose of chocolate (estimated at around 2.5 kg per year), helped Professor Robert Lefkowitz, a chemistry faculty member, win the Nobel prize in chemistry this year.
